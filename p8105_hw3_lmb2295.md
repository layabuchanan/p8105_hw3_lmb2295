This is my submission for the third homework assignment for P8105.

# Problem 2: Accelerometer Data

## Read in the data

Read in the Accelerometer dataset.

``` r
accel_df = read_csv("./data/accel_data.csv")
```

## Clean the data

This code cleans up column names, creates a weekday vs weekend variable.

``` r
accel_df =
  janitor::clean_names(accel_df) %>%  
  mutate(
    weekend = case_when(
      day == "Monday" ~ "no",
      day == "Tuesday" ~ "no",
      day == "Wednesday" ~ "no",
      day == "Thursday" ~ "no",
      day == "Friday" ~ "no",
      day == "Saturday" ~ "yes",
      day == "Sunday" ~ "yes",
      TRUE ~ ""
    )) %>%
  mutate(weekend = recode(weekend, "yes" = TRUE, "no" = FALSE)) %>% 
  relocate(weekend, .after = day)
```

Next, I will check to see if the data is encoded with reasonable
variable classes.

``` r
accel_class_df = 
  accel_df %>% 
  summarise_all(typeof) %>% 
  select(week, day_id, day, weekend, activity_1)

kable(accel_class_df)
```

| week   | day\_id | day       | weekend | activity\_1 |
| :----- | :------ | :-------- | :------ | :---------- |
| double | double  | character | logical | double      |

We can see from the table above that week, day\_id, and the activity\_\*
variables are numeric, the weekend variable is logical, and the day
variable is a character variable. These are reasonable classes for the
variable types so no further action is needed

The resulting dataset contains 35 observations and 1444 variables. The
35 observations represent 35 days of accelerometer data collected on a
63 year-old male with BMI 25, who was admitted to the Advanced Cardiac
Care Center of Columbia University Medical Center and diagnosed with
congestive heart failure. The variables include the week number for each
of the seven weeks recorded, the number of the day recorded, the day of
the week for the observed day, a variable stating whether or not the
observed day was a weekend day, as well as 1440 activity\_\* variables,
each representing an activity count for each minute in the day.

## Aggregate data

This code creates an aggregate variable displaying total activity each
day.

``` r
accel_df = 
  accel_df %>% 
  rowwise() %>% 
  mutate(total_activity = sum(c_across(activity_1:activity_1440)))%>% 
  relocate(total_activity, .after = weekend)
```

In this next chunk of code, I am using a table to explore whether there
is any obvious relationship between total daily activity and the day of
monitoring and day of the week.

``` r
aggregate_df = 
  accel_df %>% 
  select(day_id, day, total_activity)

kable(aggregate_df)
```

| day\_id | day       | total\_activity |
| ------: | :-------- | --------------: |
|       1 | Friday    |       480542.62 |
|       2 | Monday    |        78828.07 |
|       3 | Saturday  |       376254.00 |
|       4 | Sunday    |       631105.00 |
|       5 | Thursday  |       355923.64 |
|       6 | Tuesday   |       307094.24 |
|       7 | Wednesday |       340115.01 |
|       8 | Friday    |       568839.00 |
|       9 | Monday    |       295431.00 |
|      10 | Saturday  |       607175.00 |
|      11 | Sunday    |       422018.00 |
|      12 | Thursday  |       474048.00 |
|      13 | Tuesday   |       423245.00 |
|      14 | Wednesday |       440962.00 |
|      15 | Friday    |       467420.00 |
|      16 | Monday    |       685910.00 |
|      17 | Saturday  |       382928.00 |
|      18 | Sunday    |       467052.00 |
|      19 | Thursday  |       371230.00 |
|      20 | Tuesday   |       381507.00 |
|      21 | Wednesday |       468869.00 |
|      22 | Friday    |       154049.00 |
|      23 | Monday    |       409450.00 |
|      24 | Saturday  |         1440.00 |
|      25 | Sunday    |       260617.00 |
|      26 | Thursday  |       340291.00 |
|      27 | Tuesday   |       319568.00 |
|      28 | Wednesday |       434460.00 |
|      29 | Friday    |       620860.00 |
|      30 | Monday    |       389080.00 |
|      31 | Saturday  |         1440.00 |
|      32 | Sunday    |       138421.00 |
|      33 | Thursday  |       549658.00 |
|      34 | Tuesday   |       367824.00 |
|      35 | Wednesday |       445366.00 |

There doesn’t seem to be any obvious patterns. How about a chart?

``` r
accel_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = day_id, y = total_activity)) + 
  geom_point(aes(size = 4, color = day), alpha = .7) + geom_line(aes(), alpha = .5)+ 
  labs(
    title = "Day of Measurement and Total Daily Activity",
    x = "Day of Measurement",
    y = "Total Activity Count for Day",
    caption = "Activity counts displayed are in the hundered thousands, ex: 2 = 200000")+
  scale_y_continuous(
    breaks = c(200000, 400000, 600000), 
    labels = c(2, 4, 6))
```

We can kind of see some patterns here. This man’s activity level is very
variable on the weekends, with both some of his highest and loWest
activity days occuring on the weekends. His activity levels remain
closer to his mean in the middle of the week. Here’s a chart to more
fully explore this pattern:

``` r
accel_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = weekend, y = total_activity)) + 
  geom_boxplot(aes(), alpha = .5) + 
  labs(
    title = "Weekend and Total Daily Activity",
    x = "Weekend",
    y = "Total Activity Count for Day",
    caption = "Activity counts displayed are in the hundered thousands, ex: 2 = 200000") +
  scale_y_continuous(
    breaks = c(200000, 400000, 600000), 
    labels = c(2, 4, 6))
```

<img src="p8105_hw3_lmb2295_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" width="90%" />

This chart confirms our previous observations. While the mean total
daily activity is pretty similar whether or not it’s the weekend, it is
a little lower on the weekend with a much larger range of values.
