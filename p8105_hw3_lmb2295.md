This is my submission for the third homework assignment for P8105.

# Problem 2: Accelerometer Data

## Read in the data

Read in the Accelerometer dataset.

``` r
accel_df = read_csv("./data/accel_data.csv")
```

## Clean the data

This code cleans up column names, creates a weekday vs weekend variable.

``` r
accel_df =
  janitor::clean_names(accel_df) %>%  
  mutate(
    weekend = case_when(
      day == "Monday" ~ "no",
      day == "Tuesday" ~ "no",
      day == "Wednesday" ~ "no",
      day == "Thursday" ~ "no",
      day == "Friday" ~ "no",
      day == "Saturday" ~ "yes",
      day == "Sunday" ~ "yes",
      TRUE ~ ""
    )) %>%
  mutate(weekend = recode(weekend, "yes" = TRUE, "no" = FALSE)) %>% 
  relocate(weekend, .after = day)
```

Next, I will check to see if the data is encoded with reasonable
variable classes.

``` r
accel_class_df = 
  accel_df %>% 
  summarise_all(typeof) %>% 
  select(week, day_id, day, weekend, activity_1)

kable(accel_class_df)
```

| week   | day\_id | day       | weekend | activity\_1 |
| :----- | :------ | :-------- | :------ | :---------- |
| double | double  | character | logical | double      |

We can see from the table above that week, day\_id, and the activity\_\*
variables are numeric, the weekend variable is logical, and the day
variable is a character variable. These are reasonable classes for the
variable types so no further action is needed

The resulting dataset contains 35 observations and 1444 variables. The
35 observations represent 35 days of accelerometer data collected on a
63 year-old male with BMI 25, who was admitted to the Advanced Cardiac
Care Center of Columbia University Medical Center and diagnosed with
congestive heart failure. The variables include the week number for each
of the seven weeks recorded, the number of the day recorded, the day of
the week for the observed day, a variable stating whether or not the
observed day was a weekend day, as well as 1440 activity\_\* variables,
each representing an activity count for each minute in the day.

## Aggregate data

``` r
accel_df1 = 
  accel_df %>% 
  rowwise() %>% 
  mutate(total_activity = sum(c_across(activity_1:activity_1440)))%>% 
  relocate(total_activity, .after = weekend)
```
